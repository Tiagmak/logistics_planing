# Question 1

We assumed marmelade production should be restricted to an integer
value, which is not assumed in the solution, leading to slightly
different values, but it doesn't make sense to sell $0.3$ marmelade.
We also assumed only one production line was available for all
operations, like in the solution. - $0.1$

Variables correctly defined - $0.1$

Constraints correctly defined - $0.1$

# Question 2

We obtained an answer with optimization solver - $0.2$

We obtained a slightly different value, stemming from the fact we used integers - $0.09$

# Question 3

We did not use dual variables, but had an equivalent method to identify the correct production line - $0.5$

We correctly identified `Cooking` as the limiting production line - $0.1$

# Question 4

We did not explicitly state that we assumed inventory is only kept on
Earth, but our model encodes this implicit assumption. We assumed
storage starts out empty, like in the solution. We assumed only
finished products can be stored, like in the solution. We considered
'13' months for storage, which the solution doesn't require - $0.18$

We nearly correctly defined the variables, leading to a small error - $0.18$

We nearly correctly defined the constraints, leading to a small error - $0.18$

We correctly defined the objective - $0.1$

We did not formulate the problem completly correctly - $0$

We obtained nearly the correct solution with optimization solver - $0.15$
